**Time complexity** `O(ELogV)`  .. Time complexity can be reduced to `O(E + VLogV)` using Fibonacci Heap .

 ## Motivation
 
 **I've always loved the Spotify wrapped** at the end of the year to get reminded of my `top tracks` and `artists` of the year. What's even more fun is sharing your top tracks and artists with your friends. 
 
 **Sadly, Spotify Wrapped comes out only once a year**, so I thought it would be fun to build a tool that gets your Spotify `top tracks` and `artist` of the last month all year and allows us music freaks to share, preview and save these tracks seamlessly.
 
 **Another thing I always wished that Spotify allows sharing** is your `liked tracks` In your library. Currently, you can't share them or even save them to a separate playlist.

## Preview
- The website is currently hosted on netlify at https://sharify-gh.netlify.app/

## Future work
- for the future of this website, I'll add the ability to list a new pet for adoption as it only fetches the current available pets from the api rn
