 ## Motivation
 
 **I've always loved the Spotify wrapped** at the end of the year to get reminded of my `top tracks` and `artists` of the year. What's even more fun is sharing your top tracks and artists with your friends. 
 
 **Sadly, Spotify Wrapped comes out only once a year**, so I thought it would be fun to build a tool that gets your Spotify `top tracks` and `artist` of the last month all year and allows us music freaks to share, preview and save these tracks seamlessly.
 
 **Another thing I always wished that Spotify allows sharing** is your `liked tracks` In your library. Currently, you can't share them or even save them to a separate playlist.
 
 ## Capabilties
 
### **Sharify offers the following :**
- Get your `top tracks` and `artists` from your last month on Spotify.
- Get your all-time `liked tracks` on your Spotify library.
- Preview your `top tracks`, `top artists`, and `liked tracks` seamlessly on Sharify.
- Save and remove specific tracks to your Spotify library.
- Follow and Unfollow specific artists.
- Sort different tracks on the release date, popularity, and affinity.
- Sort different artists on affinity and popularity.
- Save your `top tracks` from last month to a separate playlist on your Spotify library.
- Save your `liked tracks` from last month to a separate playlist on your Spotify library.
- Share your `top tracks`, `top artists`, and `liked tracks`. Sharing is achieved by generating a preview link that your friends could open to preview and save your top tracks, top artists, and liked tracks seamlessly.
- Preview link works with any user even if they're not registered on Sharify.

## Auth

**How Sharify Authorizes the users?**

## Preview
- The website is currently hosted on netlify at https://sharify-gh.netlify.app/

## Future work
- for the future of this website, I'll add the ability to list a new pet for adoption as it only fetches the current available pets from the api rn
